Allied Changes

===== BUFFS =============


Power Plant Buff          - Allied power plant takes the same amount of time to consctruct as the soviet tesla reactor 

Robot Control Center      - Robot Control Center now only drains 10% of what it origionally did 

Chrono Miner              - Can now store 625 ore instead of 500. This means it will spend more time out gathering ore and less time traveling to and from the refinary 

Grizzly Tank              - Speed +1, just a tiny bit faster than normal and has a slightly better movement speed over ore in general (comparable to an ore miner)

Tank Destroyer            - Range DOUBLED - No longer requires Radar to build

Harrier                   - Build Speed: 10% fasterÂ· Harrier Speed: +1 (a little faster than normal, barley noticable)

Eagle                     - Deals Area of effect damage vs tanks but less damage to direct hits (150 to be exact which is same as harrier) 
                            This is so Eagle can still miss but will still do SOME damage
                            
                              - Area of Effect is not applicable to buildings and will do normal damage to buildings.   (IE; 3 for radar, lab)                    
                              - Weapons are totally different, a shot that misses a tank next to a building will not harm the building with AOE. 
                              - Buildings can only be harmed if targeted and fired upon or if the eagle crashes into the building

Spy                       - Speed reduced by 1 (same speed as GGI)  Blackout time from inflitrating power plant increased from 1 minute to 3.5 minutes

Seal IFV                  - Does not auto target tanks however will still return fire if hit by them

Chrono Legionnaire        - Auto Heals and has same amrour and strength as a Deso. Fixed Origional bug where Elite could not fire over walls

Desolator                 -  Deals Damage to self when deploying (MELTDOWN logic)

                              - Deals less damage to self when spaced appart by 2 - 3 cells or solo
                              - Damage will kill the desolator if deployed 5 times in a row in quick succession 
                              - Damage in groups of 3 on the same cell will leave all deso's with 1 hp when deployed once
                              - Damage in groups of 4 will kill 3 out of 4 deso with the surviving deso being the one on the other cell (survivor will have 1 hp)
                              - Deso still can self heal - this creates a nice cooldown scenerio where players will have to micro their desolators
